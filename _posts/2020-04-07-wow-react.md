title: WOW! Handling multiple form flow in React.

# What's React?

You need help.

Lol just kidding. Here's what React is:

* It is a JavaScript library created by Facebook
* It is a User Interface (UI) library
* It is a tool for building UI components

You can see [this](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_react.asp) and [this](https://reactjs.org/)

# What did I just do?

Alright, I was working on a multi-flow form with multiple formgroups, form validations and state flow.
I finsished the first step of the form. It wasn't hard but took me almost a day.

I used React Router for flawless flow of data through my components across different stages of the form.

Imma show you guys a simple example of how all of this works.

## Setup

I assume you guys know a bit React and its structure.

```js
import React from 'react';
import {
 BrowserRouter as Router,
 Switch,
 Route,
 Link,
 Redirect
} from 'react-router-dom';

class Form {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      formValues: {
        email: ""
      },
      formErrors: {
        email:""
      },
      submitted: false // this will be used to pass on the current form values.
    }
  }
  handleChange = () => {
    // Handle for change here. Do some valididation and stuff
  }
  render() {
    const { formValues, submitted } = this.state;
    if(submitted) {
      return <Redirect to={{ location:"/step2", state: formValues }} /> // Simple!!
    }
    return (
      <>
        <div class"form-group">
          <input type="email" name="email" type="form-control" onChange={handleChange} placeholder="Enter your email ID" />
          <button class="btn btn-success">Submit</button>
        </div>
      </>
    )
  }
}
```

I suggest you to read the code and figure everything out (no spoon feeding). It's not much, it's quite interesting.

See you in the next post! :)
