title: Quid - a psych-like multiplayer game written in Haxe and Node.js
---

Quid is a psych-like muktiplayer game which I originally made for my friends.
(though i haven't ever hosted it). It works charm for me.

While in quarantine, I decided to do something productive which could help me learn new concepts and languages. And I stumbled upon Haxe. It has a similar syntax to Javascript and It compiles to a hell lot of languages!

I was sure that I had to try it out and so I did. On third day of my Haxe journey I decided to make this. I tried to make the server in Haxe too but I like Node.js better in the server-side plus there is not much documentation for using Haxe with Node.js.

Here's how you can try it out.

## What you will need

The following are the requirements for hosting Quid.
* Node.js - Javascript runtime enviornment
* Haxe - The wonderful compiler for the Haxe language.

Once you have them installed, you can head over to the [Installation](#Installing)  section.
## Installing

Quid is made using Haxe and Node.js
Note: I have using Haxe as the client and Node.js as the server

```bash
 # the first step is to clone the repository.
 $ git clone https://github.com/divy-work/quid

 # next, we enter the git directory and run build script command
 $ cd ./quid && ./build.sh
 # If it gives an error, please check that you have Haxe compiler and Node.js installed on your machine.
```

Well done! You've successfully hosted Quid locally!

Now, head over to `localhost:5000` and enjoy. :smile:
